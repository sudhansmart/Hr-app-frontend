# HR Application

## Overview

The HR Application is a comprehensive tool built using the React framework, designed to help HR teams manage candidates, track recruiter performance, and handle user authentication and authorization. This application integrates various features that streamline recruitment processes, track candidate data, and monitor the performance of recruiters. The system is role-based, supporting recruiters and administrators with different levels of access and functionality.

## Features

- **Candidate Tracker**: 
  - Add, edit, and delete candidate profiles.
  - Search candidates by name or contact information.
  - Track candidate progress through the recruitment stages.
  - Manage candidate details, including job information, communication ratings, experience, and more.

- **User Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Secure login for recruiters and admins using token-based authentication (JWT).
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) to provide recruiters and admins with specific functionality.
  - Password hashing and secure authentication flow.
  
- **Recruiter Performance Tracker**:
  - Track recruiter activities and performance based on candidates they handle.
  - Monitor the number of successful recruitments, open positions, and overall productivity.
  - Admin dashboard with recruiter analytics and performance insights.

- **Admin and Recruiter Dashboards**:
  - Admin dashboard to manage recruiters and oversee the recruitment process.
  - Recruiter dashboard for managing personal performance, candidates, and progress.
  
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Fully responsive design for optimal user experience on different screen sizes.
  - Adaptive layouts for web and mobile views.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React (JavaScript, functional components)
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for API requests
  - Formik & Yup for form handling and validation

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js with Express
  - MongoDB for data storage
  - JWT for user authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB instance or MongoDB Atlas account.
- User ID -- Skylark@001
- password -- qwe123
  
### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/hr-application.git](https://github.com/sudhansmart/Hr-app-frontend.git)
   cd hr-application
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=<backend API URL>
   ```

   For backend:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=<your MongoDB connection string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your secret key for JWT>
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   To start the application in development mode, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. **Backend Setup**:

   Follow similar steps for the backend repository if it's separated. Ensure that the API URL for the frontend matches the backend API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Folder Structure

- **src/**: Contains all source files.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable React components like forms, modals, buttons, etc.
  - **pages/**: Pages for different parts of the app, like Dashboard, Candidate List, Login, etc.
  - **services/**: API services to handle HTTP requests.
  - **context/**: Contains global state and context management files.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions like authentication helpers, validation, etc.

## API Routes (Backend)

- **Authentication**:
  - POST `/api/auth/login`: Login user and return JWT.
  - POST `/api/auth/signup`: Register a new user.
  - GET `/api/auth/user`: Get user details based on JWT.

- **Candidate Management**:
  - GET `/api/candidates`: Fetch all candidates.
  - POST `/api/candidates`: Add a new candidate.
  - PUT `/api/candidates/:id`: Update candidate information.
  - DELETE `/api/candidates/:id`: Remove a candidate from the system.

- **Recruiter Performance**:
  - GET `/api/recruiters/performance`: Get recruiter performance data.

## Authentication and Authorization

This app uses JWT-based authentication, where each user (Admin or Recruiter) is authenticated by a token that is sent with each request. Admins have higher-level access and can manage recruiters and view their performance data, while recruiters only have access to their own performance and candidates.
